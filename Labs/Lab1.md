Task 2:
-------
Register your machine
=====================


>:information_source:**Note**
>
>If you haven't previously registered your machine to another environment, Power Automate Desktop will automatically register your machine to the default environment at installing time, so you don't need to do the following steps manually. However, we still recommend that you try to follow the subsequent steps.

To register your machine, follow these steps:

1.  Search for **Power Automate machine runtime** from the Windows search bar in the lower part of your desktop.
    
2.  Select the **Power Automate machine runtime** app.
    
    ![Screenshot of the Power Automate machine runtime application result.](images/1-17.png)
    
3.  The **Power Automate machine runtime** app opens. **Sign in** if prompted.
    
    ![Screenshot of the Power Automate machine runtime app, with the Sign in button.](images/1-18.png)
    
4.  Select the dev environment that you created.
    
    ![Screenshot of the Power Automate machine runtime machine settings.](images/1-19.png)
    
5.  You can select the **Register machine** button to register your machine to the default environment. If you have multiple environments and want to register your machine to a different environment than the default one, you can use the **Environment** dropdown menu to select the desired environment and then select **Register**.
    
>:information_source:**Note**
>Power Automate will only allow the cloud flows in the registered environment to trigger desktop flows to run on your machine.
    
>:information_source:**Note**
>If your environment does not register properly, select the **Learn More** button within the notification ribbon that appears at the top of the window. Follow the steps within to then ensure that you can now register your machine to the desired environment.
    
6.  After you register successfully, information displays in the machine runtime app, as shown in the following screenshot.
    
    ![Screenshot of the registered machine.](images/1-20.png)
    
7.  In the future, you can also use the **Machine group** settings to add more machines to one machine group and then manage them together. For more information, seeÂ [Manage machine groups](/en-us/power-automate/desktop-flows/manage-machine-groups/?azure-portal=true).
    
8.  Close the Power Automate machine runtime application.
    

>:information_source:**Note**
>Users will need an Environment Maker or desktop Flow Machine Owner role permission to register machines. Before registering a machine, make sure that you have the required permissions and that an available environment is present for you to register the new machine in.


Task 3:
-------
Install the Coffee Shop Contoso invoice app (for lab scenario use)
==================================================================


This lab uses a coffee shop company business scenario to demonstrate how to automate manual invoice processing steps by using Power Automate desktop flow and cloud flows. This coffee shop company uses a Win32 application to manually manage their invoice system. Your first task is to download and install this application to prepare for the lab.



1.  Download [**ContosoInvoicingSetup.exe** and **ContosoInvoicingSetup.msi**](https://aka.ms/AutomationIADStudent) from the **Prerequisite Lab #1 Install Contoso Coffee Shop Invoicing management app** folder from the downloaded files. Double-click the .exe file to install the **ContosoInvoicingSetup** application.
    
>**Note**
>You'll need to select **More Information** and **Run it anyway** during the installation of the Contoso app _if_ Windows Defender prompts that the app is coming from an untrusted source.
    
2.  After the installation is fully complete, launch the **Contoso Invoicing app** from the **Start** menu by using the search bar in the lower part of your Windows desktop. Within the search bar, type **Contoso Invoicing**.
    
3.  Right-click the app icon located in the lower task bar of your desktop and then select the option to **pin** the app icon to the **task bar** for quick launch. You use this app in subsequent labs, for the Process advisor and the robotic processing automation recordings.
    
    ![Screenshot of the Pin to taskbar button.](images/1-21.png)
    
    Next, spend some time getting familiar with the Contoso Invoicing app. These steps explore how the Contoso Coffee shop employee manually enters a new invoice record into the company application system when a new invoice is received. This lab helps you better prepare for the following labs.
    
4.  With the **Contoso Invoicing App** open, select **Invoices** from the left pane.
    
    ![Screenshot of the Contoso Invoicing application running.](images/1-22.png)
    
5.  Select the **New record** icon from the ribbon in the upper-left corner of the screen to create a new invoice.
    
    ![Screenshot of the Contoso Invoicing application running with the new invoice record icon highlighted.](images/1-23.png)
    
6.  You can fill in any information for the new invoice in the text boxes that appear in the center of the screen. For this example, enter the following information:
    
    *   **Date** - (Current date)
        
    *   **Account** - Admin Account
        
    *   **Contact** - (Email that you used to sign in to the accounts)
        
    *   **Amount** - $100.00
        
    *   **Status** - Paid
        
    
    ![Screenshot of the create new invoice record form.](images/1-24.png)
    
7.  Select the **Save** icon from the ribbon in the upper-left corner of the screen to save your new invoice.
    
    ![Screenshot of the save invoice record button.](images/1-25.png)
